# popgen_scripts

ABC_esterase: Scripts and data from estimation of time since esterase duplication sweep.
dadi_scripts: Scripts for running dadi to fit 1D demographic models to the synonymous SFS from Trivandrum, Lakshadweep, and Kochi. Best fit was the bottlegrowth model for TVM and K, growth-bottleneck for LKD. Highest likelihood parameters from 100 runs were used for subsequent simulations with msms.
pca: Commands to perform principal component analysis of genome-wide SNPs for all 115 samples.
pop_divergence_simulations: Commands to simulate population divergence and calculate allele frequency correlation coefficients.
sweep_scans: Commands to run SweepFinder2 and HapStats (G12) to detect selective sweeps, plus Slim script to simulate SFS of selective sweeps using An. stephensi mutation rate and large population size.
