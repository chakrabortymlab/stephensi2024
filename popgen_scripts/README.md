dadi_...py: Scripts for running dadi to fit 1D demographic models to the synonymous SFS from Trivandrum. Best fit was the bottlegrowth model, which was run 100 times and parameters with highest likelihood were used for subsequent simulations.
G12.sh: Script for preparing SNP data for input to calculate the G123 statistic, as well as msms command for neutral simulations to determine significance threshold.
sweepfinder2.sh: Script for preparing SNP data for input to SweepFinder2.
