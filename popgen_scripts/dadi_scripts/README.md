# dadi_scripts

Scripts for running dadi to fit 1D demographic models to the synonymous SFS from Trivandrum, Lakshadweep, and Kochi. Best fit was the bottlegrowth model for TVM and K, growth-bottleneck for LKD. Highest likelihood parameters from 100 runs were used for subsequent simulations with msms.
